As a contractor, I maintained and developed software in various companies, in as many different technical environments.

At Wincor-Nixdorf (ATM manufacturer), I designed, implemented and integrated a new customization system for the HMI of ATMs: a web browser (<IconText name="devicon:firefox">_Mozilla 1.4_</IconText>) was to be embedded in the existing software to parse XML, create and display HTML files to the user (<IconText name="devicon:cplusplus">_C++_</IconText>, _HTML 4.02_, _CSS 2.0_, _XML 1.0_, <IconText name="devicon:firefox">_Mozilla 1.4_</IconText>, _RPC_).

At IdRS (SERVIER, pharmaceutical laboratory), I maintained the internal Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) (<IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C#_</IconText>, <IconText name="devicon:dot-net">_.NET 1.1_</IconText>, _XML 1.0_, <IconText name="devicon:oracle">_Oracle 9i_</IconText>), which was also the opportunity to discover the .NET world. After a few month, I have been officially designed as a &quot;.NET Expert&quot; to serve as a reference to other developers. I took the initiative to develop a reusable framework destined to help the creation of Data Access Layers (DAL) in the environment of the IdRS (10+ projects each had their own specific DAL, and existing commercial or free solutions where out the question for political reasons). It was successfully used in 2 projects (<IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C#_</IconText>, <IconText name="devicon:dot-net">_.NET 1.1_</IconText>, _CodeSmith 2.6_, _PL/SQL_, <IconText name="devicon:oracle">_Oracle 9i_</IconText>).
