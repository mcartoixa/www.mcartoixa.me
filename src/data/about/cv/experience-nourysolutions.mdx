I designed and developed [Salamanca](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630214922/https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=salamanca), an open source software factory targeting business applications on the .NET platform (<IconText name="devicon:visualstudio">_Visual Studio 2008_</IconText>). This included the design and development of specific libraries, modelers and code generation templates (_SQL_, <IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C#_</IconText>). I also advocated and set up corporate blogs to help communicate about Salamanca.

Designed and developed information systems based on Salamanca (<IconText name="devicon:microsoftsqlserver">_Sql Server_</IconText>, <IconText name="devicon:oracle">_Oracle_</IconText>, <IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C#_</IconText>, _Windows Forms_, _ASP.NET_, _WPF_). I advocated for and set up various development tools and processes (_FxCop_, <IconText name="devicon:subversion">_Subversion_</IconText>, _Trac_, _unit testing_, _automated builds_) to improve software quality (and pave the way to complete continuous integration). I also advocated, set up and managed a virtualization server (<IconText name="devicon:hyperv">_Hyper-V_</IconText>) to help us test software and installation packages.
