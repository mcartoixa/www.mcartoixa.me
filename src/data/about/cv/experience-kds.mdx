import IconText from '../../../components/IconText.astro';

I advocated for the development of unit tests, and helped define and enforce custom unit tests development rules (_xUnit_).

I migrated the build of the main KDS application to MSBuild (from a mix of NAnt, Powershell, makefiles and batch scripts).

I rationalized and automated the build of the middleware (around 60 projects amounting to about 1 million LOC of C++, Delphi and C#)(_MSBuild 3.5_, <IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C#_</IconText>). Rethought its release process and set up a continuous integration server (_CruiseControl.NET_, _Subversion_, _MSBuild_). Added various code quality checks and metrics (_FxCop_, _Cppcheck_). Developed new core libraries to base the development of new middleware components on (and possibly migrate old components over time) (<IconText name="devicon:csharp">_C# 4.0_</IconText>, _Task Parallel Library_, _sockets_).

Set up a continuous integration process for the development of mobile applications (_CruiseControl.NET_, _MSBuild_, _Ant_).
